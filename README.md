# TR2 Actuator Network
This purpose of this repository is to bridge communications between the main onboard computer (MOC) of the TR2 and the actuators and various wireless endpoints of the TR2. This serves as a router and enables the MOC to communicate with the endpoints without interrupting its own wireless communications.
